# Problem Statement 1: Skill Swap Platform

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today's knowledge-driven economy, individuals possess diverse skills but often lack platforms to effectively share and exchange their expertise. Traditional learning methods can be expensive, time-consuming, and lack personalization. There's a need for a community-driven platform where people can:

- **Share their expertise** with others who want to learn
- **Learn new skills** from experienced community members
- **Build meaningful connections** through skill exchange
- **Create a sustainable learning ecosystem** without monetary transactions

## 🚀 Solution Overview

The **Skill Swap Platform** is a web-based application that connects individuals for mutual skill exchange. Users can offer skills they excel at and request skills they want to learn, creating a collaborative learning environment where everyone benefits.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API, Vite, and modern UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js RESTful API
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **State Management**: Pinia for Vue.js state management

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. User Management
- **User Registration & Authentication**
- **Profile Management** with skills offered/wanted
- **User Rating System** for quality assurance
- **Admin Dashboard** for platform management

#### 2. Skill Management
- **Dynamic Skill Listing** with categories
- **Skill Search & Filtering**
- **Skill Level Indicators** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
- **Trending Skills** tracking

#### 3. Swap System
- **Skill Matching Algorithm**
- **Swap Request Management**
- **Status Tracking** (Pending, Accepted, Completed, Rejected)
- **Feedback System** for completed swaps

#### 4. Discovery & Search
- **User Discovery** based on skills
- **Advanced Search** with location and skill filters
- **Skill Categories** for easy browsing
- **Match Score Calculation** for better recommendations
